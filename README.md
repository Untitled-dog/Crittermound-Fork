# Crittermound-Fork
Fork of Crittermound
Originally developed by www.reddit.com/user/brave_powerful_ruler.  Code moved to github for collaboration after his passing.  
For the incremental game Crittermound.  Looking for someone to take over as I have no experience with github and very little
with JS/CSS/HTML.
